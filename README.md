The present study deals with sequence-dependent operations, the sequencing problem which is quite common in many industries. The main idea is to minimize the makespan time thus reducing the idle time of both jobs and machines since these criteria are often applied for operational decision-making in scheduling.

Many heuristics and meta-heuristics can find quick,
feasible solutions to such sequencing problems that involve
multiple jobs and machines and sequence-dependent
operations. But, as far as simplicity of the algorithm and
promising results are concerned, the proposed method is
more effective than the existing methods. In realistic
situation, the proposed algorithm can be used such as it is
without any modification and come out with acceptable
results. In that manner the approach can be recommended
for industries that deal with variety of parts and machines
with more operations.
